                                    “I am very pleased that we became laureates in this particular nomination: after
                                    all, the future is behind those who offer a client-oriented, or client-centered,
                                    approach in business. The success awaits those who will be able to come to their
                                    clients with the products they really need at the exact moment when it is most
                                    relevant to them, and use a convenient channel to communicate with the customer.
                                    Digitization and Big Data are first helpers here. Over the past several years
                                    Gazprombank has done a lot in this area.

                                    Private Banking might be a traditionally more conservative and classic segment where
                                    we know each of our clients well a priori, nevertheless, new technologies will
                                    inevitably come into our business as well. Therefore, we see our future development
                                    in the synergy between the impeccable work of our account managers and use of
                                    cutting-edge technologies. This victory is well deserved due to the hard work of the
                                    cohesive team of Gazprombank Private Banking!” said Sergey Potapeyko, Vice President
                                    and Head of the Private Banking Department.
